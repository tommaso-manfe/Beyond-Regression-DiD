This folder contains the coding material of the working paper “Alternative Semi-Parametric Approaches and Machine Learning Algorithms in The Difference-In-Difference Design: a Monte-Carlo Evaluation” which compares new semi-parametric estimators for the DiD design with the traditional DiD regression.
- The file 'PAPER_MN_github.pdf" is the text of the working paper
- in "MC simulations" the coding material of the Monte Carlo simulations can be found 
- in "Replication_final-original" you can find the code of the replication of the paper "Corruption, trade costs, and gains from tariff liberalization: Evidence from southern africa" of Sequeira (2016) where new estimation methods are employed.

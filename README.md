This folder contains the coding material of the thesis “BEYOND REGRESSION: EVALUATING DIFFERENT SEMIPARAMETRIC APPROACHES AND MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS IN THE DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE DESIGN” which compares new semi-parametric estimators for the DiD design with the traditional DiD regression.
- The file 'DiD Beyond Regression" is the text of the thesis
- in "MC simulations" the coding material of the Monte Carlo simulations can be found 
- in "Replication_final-original" you can find the code of the replication of the paper "Corruption, trade costs, and gains from tariff liberalization: Evidence from southern africa" of Sequeira (2016) where new estimation methods are employed.
